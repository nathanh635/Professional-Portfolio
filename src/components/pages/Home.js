      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
      I graduated with a Bachelors of Applied Sciences in Environmental Engineering from University of Waterloo in 2012.
      I worked for 10 years in environmental consulting assessing soil and groundwater conditions at a number of sites in western Canada. </p>

      <p>     
      As a project manager, I directed a number of soil and groundwater assessment and management programs in both urban and rural settings. The projects ranged in scale from small scale to
      annual monitoring, assessment, and remediation for clients within Calgary and energy companies at sites north of Fort McMurray.

      </p>

      <p>
      After some time I found that I was looking for something different. So I made the decision to enroll in the University of Toronto SCS Coding Bootcamp. 
      I now have a breadth of skills, both front-end (HTML, CSS, Javascript, Handlebars, and React) and back-end (NodeJS, ExpressJS, MySQL, MongoDB, GraphQL).
      This portfolio was built using React.</p>

      <h2>My Aspirations</h2>
<p>
      I would like to find a position which allows me to leverage both my environmental engineering background as well as my full stack development abilities.
      I am passionate about environmental protection, mitigating the effects of climate change, and striving for energy efficiency and green energy, and would
      like to find a way to make a difference.
