      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
      I graduated with a Bachelors of Applied Sciences in Environmental Engineering from University of Waterloo in 2012.
      I worked for 10 years in environmental consulting assessing soil and groundwater conditions at a number of sites in western Canada.
      After some time I found that I was looking for something different.
      So I made the decision to enroll in the University of Toronto SCS Coding Bootcamp. 
      So far, we've learned HTML, CSS, and advanced CSS, and I used this to put together this webpage.

      <h2>My Aspirations</h2>

      I would like to find a position which allows me to leverage both my environmental engineering background as well as my full stack development abilities.
      I am passionate about environmental protection, mitigating the effects of climate change, and striving for energy efficiency and green energy, and would
      like to find a way to make a difference.
